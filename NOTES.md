<!--
Idea list for the improvements:

-Have Nerea change the color scheme
-Dark mode
-Spanish mode
-Autocheck (add button to toggle on/off)
-Resizing for smaller screens
-set timeout for screens using a touchpad instead of a hover feature to unclick buttons

*** Make the game somthing fun, with a little spin to it
